**Validation Status:** PENDING

#### Review Plan

```
Current Internal Reasoning Loop: 1/2
## Security Review Plan

### Scope
I will examine the following specific security areas within this initial commit for the "agentswarm" PR review system:

1. **Secrets and Credentials Management** - Review how API keys and tokens are handled
2. **Code Injection Vulnerabilities** - Examine dynamic code execution, eval usage, and command injection risks
3. **Input Validation and Sanitization** - Check user inputs, file paths, and external data handling
4. **Dependency Security** - Review third-party packages and their known vulnerabilities
5. **File System Operations** - Analyze file read/write operations for path traversal and unsafe operations
6. **Authentication and Authorization** - Review any access control mechanisms
7. **Data Exposure Risks** - Check for sensitive data logging or insecure storage
8. **Subprocess and Command Execution** - Review any system command execution
9. **Error Handling and Information Disclosure** - Examine exception handling for information leakage

### Checklist
- [ ] SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Authentication/Authorization flaws
- [ ] Secrets/credentials in code
- [ ] Insecure dependencies
- [ ] Data exposure risks
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Cryptography usage
- [ ] Path traversal vulnerabilities
- [ ] Command injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Arbitrary code execution risks
- [ ] Insecure file operations
- [ ] Information disclosure through error messages
- [ ] Insecure temporary file handling

### Methodology

**1. Static Code Analysis Approach:**
   - Line-by-line review of all Python source files
   - Pattern matching for dangerous functions (eval, exec, subprocess, os.system)
   - Review of environment variable handling
   - Analysis of file I/O operations

**2. Configuration Review:**
   - Examine .env.example for credential patterns
   - Review requirements.txt for known vulnerable packages
   - Check for hardcoded secrets or API keys

**3. Data Flow Analysis:**
   - Trace user input from entry points through the application
   - Identify sanitization and validation points
   - Map sensitive data handling paths

**4. Dependency Assessment:**
   - Review all imported packages
   - Check for known CVEs in dependencies
   - Assess version pinning and security implications

**5. Binary and Script Analysis:**
   - Review any executable files for suspicious content
   - Analyze shell scripts or batch files

**6. Logging and Error Handling Review:**
   - Check what data is logged to console/files
   - Review exception handling for information disclosure
   - Assess temporary file handling security

**7. Privilege and Access Control:**
   - Review any authentication mechanisms
   - Check for privilege escalation risks
   - Assess authorization boundaries

I will now proceed to Phase 2 execution following this exact plan.
